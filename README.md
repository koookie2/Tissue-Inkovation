# Tissue-Inkovation
A GUI tool to predict bioink printability and viability in an in-vivo-like environment before creation.

## Overview
Hello Inkovators! Tissue Inkovation is a machine learning project created for the TJHSST's 2025 Biocode Hackathon. The goal was to design a user-friendly page for users to access this model. This page provides a more convenient way to get predictions for bioink printability and viability. The highest-accuracy model attained an F1 score of 0.9919, which signifies a strong balance in the model's precision and accuracy.

## Directions
1. Ensure that your browser is up to date, along with the latest versions of all necessary packages/dependencies (Tensorflow, Numpy, and tkinter).
2. Download the most recent version of this repository.
3. Either go to this Giadio link: https://702d22feb0eddb70d1.gradio.live or extract, download, and run the TissueInkovation.pkl file.
4. Enter all of the requested parameters (MUST be numbers) in the text boxes or select a preset.
5. Receive your prediction! (Predictions of 100% or 0% usually mean that you did not input the data correctly)

Enjoy!
